## Raytracer
More on the project can be found [here](https://kagonkhan.github.io/RayTracingCS/). Currently a work-in-progress as there are some abnormalities and features not yet implemented. The project is based on the ***The Ray Tracer Challenge*** book by ***Jamis Buck***. Current features support multiple light sources, transparency, reflectivity, materials, patterns, and more!. A vector/matrix basic library has been implemented as well.

## SpaceRanger
More on the project can be found [here](https://kagonkhan.github.io/SpaceRanger/). A 2D space shooting game, utilizing the SFML library. The game style choice was inspired by the Space Invaders title. Many game techniques (natural movement, tracking systems, collision detection) and design patterns (singletons, commands, inheritance trees, flyweights, states, factories) have been utilized. Additionally, a GUI system has been implemented.

### AutoHotkey
A [collection](https://github.com/KagonKhan/RepoLection/tree/main/AHK) of useful scripts at the time. Currently `mousePos` finder and `image` finder. Can be used for an auto clicker finding images on screen.


### Algorithms
A [collection](https://github.com/KagonKhan/RepoLection/tree/main/Algorithms) of code files related to algorithmics. Data structures, graphs, sorting,  challenges, etc...



### Audio manipulation
A [Library](https://github.com/KagonKhan/RepoLection/tree/main/AudioManipulationProject/AudioManipulation) for generating waves (sine, triangle, saw, rectangular), notes, applying envelopes, adding echoes, and filters!


### OpenGL
SDL version tutorial and following the OpenGL [book](https://learnopengl.com/) found [here](https://github.com/KagonKhan/RepoLection/tree/main/OpenGL)
TODO: Add results


### Regular Expressions
Space for learning RegEx (good regex library in cpp when?)


### Web Applications
Python based web apps. Django, Django with flavor (bootstrap), and Flask apps.
TODO: Add results, more description


### Mini Games
A [collection](https://github.com/KagonKhan/RepoLection/tree/main/unfinished-games) of either smaller, unfinished, or WIP games.
-  Tetris-dragging-puzzle game.
-  Checkers.
-  Doodle Jump.
-  Flabby birb (PyGame).
-  IdleOn mining minigame (PyGame).
-  SFML based RPG.
-  SFML based GUI system.
